Conway's Game of Life

This is the project for the hackathon at the University of Michigan, MHacks. MHacks took place on September 2013.

Games of Life emulates Conway's Game of Life, except the user can alter the rules of the automata, such as changing the number of adjacent cells such that a cell is born or dies.
